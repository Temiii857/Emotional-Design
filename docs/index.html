                    Emotional design is the idea that digital products are not just made to function but to make people feel something while using them. 
                    Apps and websites today are designed in very intentional ways to create emotions like trust, excitement and comfort. 
                    Some of these emotional choices are positive and supportive like when an app helps users feel safe while entering personal information or encourages them to reach their goals without adding stress. 
                    But emotional design can also cross the line and become manipulative like when apps pressure people into making fast decisions with fake countdown timers or guilt-based language. 
                    The goal of this website is to explore both the positive and the harmful sides of emotional design and to explain how it can improve user experience or be used in unethical ways to push engagement or profit. 
                    This guide will look at real examples from apps, psychological design principles and ethical boundaries that designers should avoid crossing. 
                    Understanding emotional design is important especially for future designers and developers because emotions can influence decisions more strongly than information alone.
